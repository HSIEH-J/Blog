<p>In the 20th century, most vaccines took over a decade to research, test, and produce. But the vaccines for COVID-19 were cleared for emergency use in less than 11 months. The secret behind this speed is a medical technology that's been developing for decades: the mRNA vaccine. So how do these revolutionary vaccines work? Kaitlyn Sadtler and Elizabeth Wayne dig into the science of mRNA technology. [Directed by Igor Ćorić, Artrake Studio, narrated by Bethany Cutmore-Scott, music by Nikola Radivojevic].</p>
